# Loan_Interest_rate :

Problem Statement : We have been given data for people applying for a loan to a peer-to-peer lending firm. The data contains details of loan application and eventually how much interest rate was offered to people by the platform. Our solution needs to be able to predict the interest rate which will be offered to people , given their application detail as inputs. We need to minimze mean error

Solution: we are implementing different algoritms for this problem and try to find mean error. The least mean error will be considered as good model
